# Kubernetes External Provisioner

This is an minamlistic External Provisioner skeleton.  The Provision(..) and Delete(...) calls throw errors and dont actually provision anything.  

* To Build *
```make```

This can run outside of Kube with KUBECONFIG env variable set or specifying kubeconfig via CLI. Will also run as a container.
